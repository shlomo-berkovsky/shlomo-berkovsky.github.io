I lead the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/Research-Streams/Clinical-AI-and-Sensing-Technologies" target="_blank">Clinical AI and Sensing Technologies stream</a> at the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/aihi-research-centres/health-informatics" target="_blank">Centre for Health Informatics</a>, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University. We focus on the use of Artificial Intelligence methods to develop models and predictions of diagnosis and care. We also study how sensors and physiological responses can predict medical conditions, and how clinicians and patients interact with health technologies. 

Computer Scientist by training, I have theoretical and applied expertise in several areas related to human-centric applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My core research areas have been user modelling, personalised technologies, human-centric AI, and behaviour change systems, all at the intersection of Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. As such, my work is around the interaction of people with information, technologies, and other people. Other areas of experise include recommender systems, exergaming, and human aspects of cybersecurity. 

I have extensive experience in leading cross-functional teams and projects, both in the research and industry environments. In the past, I established the Personalised Information Delivery team of the CSIRO ICT Centre, led the Interactive Behaviour Analytics team of Data61, and managed the Data Science and Product Analytics team at Atlassian Inc. I have supervised post-doctoral fellows, PhD and Masters students, Honours theses, and projects of post- and under-graduate interns.

Also, I have a sustained record of scientific leadership, evidenced by close to 200 publications at prestigious journals and conferences, steadily increasing citation track, conference Best Paper awards, keynote talks and tutorials, strong research funding stream, and leading large-scale research activities. Currently, I am the editor-in-chief of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tiis" target="_blank">ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems</a> and I have chaired and organised numerous international conferences. Throughout career, I have secured close to $20M of research funding and led projects in excess of $5M.

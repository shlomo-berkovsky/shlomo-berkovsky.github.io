I lead the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/Research-Streams/Clinical-AI-and-Sensing-Technologies" target="_blank">Clinical AI and Sensing Technologies</a> research stream at the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/aihi-research-centres/health-informatics" target="_blank">Centre for Health Informatics</a>, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University. Our translational research focusses on the use of AI methods to develop models and predictions of diagnosis and care. Also, we study how sensors and physiological responses can predict medical conditions, and how clinicians and patients interact with health technologies and, in particular, with decision-support and generative AI tools. 

Computer Scientist by training, I have deep theoretical and applied expertise in several areas related to human-centric applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My core research areas have been user modelling, personalised technologies, human-centric AI, and behaviour change systems, all at the intersection of Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. As such, my work is generally around the interaction of humans with information and technologies, and their technology-mediated interaction with other humans. Other areas of experise include recommender systems, exergaming, and human aspects of cybersecurity. 

I have extensive experience in leading cross-functional teams and collaborative projects, both in the academic and industry environments. In the past, I established the Personalised Information Delivery team of the CSIRO ICT Centre, led the Interactive Behaviour Analytics team of Data61, and managed the Data Science and Product Analytics team at Atlassian Inc. I have succeassfully supervised post-doctoral fellows, PhD and Masters students, Honours theses, and projects of post- and under-graduate interns.

Also, I have a sustained record of scientific leadership, evidenced by close to 200 publications at prestigious journals and conferences, steadily increasing citation track, conference Best Paper awards, keynote talks and tutorials, strong research funding stream, and leading large-scale research activities. Currently, I am the editor-in-chief of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tiis" target="_blank">ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems</a> and I have chaired and organised numerous international conferences. Throughout career, I have secured close to \$20M of research funding and led projects in excess of \$5M.

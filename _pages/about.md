The stream focusses on the use of machine learning methods to develop patient models and personalised predictions of diagnosis and care. The stream also studies how sensors and physiological responses can predict medical conditions, and how clinicians and patients interact with health technologies. 

Shlomo is Computer Scientist by training, with deep theoretical and applied expertise of several areas related to human-centric applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. His core research areas are user modelling, personalised technologies, and recommender systems, which lie on the intersection of Data Science and Human-Computer Interaction. As such, he studies how people interact online with information, technologies, and other people. He possesses solid experience in eHealth and mHealth applications, behaviour change technologies, and exergaming. 

Shlomo has an extensive experience in leading research teams and projects. He established the Personalised Information Delivery team of the CSIRO ICT Centre, led the Interactive Behaviour Analytics team of Data61, and Data Science and Product Analytics team at Atlassian. He has successfully supervised post-doctoral fellows, PhD and Masters students, Honours theses, and projects of post- and under-graduate interns.

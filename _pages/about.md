<p>I lead the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/Research-Streams/Clinical-AI-and-Sensing-Technologies" target="_blank">Clinical AI and Sensing Technologies</a> research stream at the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/aihi-research-centres/health-informatics" target="_blank">Centre for Health Informatics</a>, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University. Our translational research focusses on the use of AI and Engineering methods to develop personalised models and predictions of diagnosis and care. We also study how sensors and physiological responses predict medical conditions, and how clinicians and patients interact with health technologies and, in particular, with decision-support and generative AI tools.</p>

<p>Computer Scientist by training, I have deep theoretical and applied research expertise in several areas related to human-centric applications of AI and Machine Learning. My core research areas include user modelling, personalised technologies, human-centric AI, and behaviour change systems, all place at the intersection of the Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction disciplines. As such, my work is studies human interaction with information and technologies, and technology-mediated human-to-human online interaction. Other areas of proven experise include recommender systems, decision-support systems, and human aspects of cybersecurity.</p> 

<p>I have extensive experience in leading cross-functional teams and collaborative projects, both in the academic and industry environments. In the past, I established the Personalised Information Delivery team of the CSIRO ICT Centre, led the Interactive Behaviour Analytics team of Data61, and managed the Data Science and Product Analytics teams at Atlassian Inc. I have succeassfully supervised early-career researchers: post-doctoral fellows, graduate PhD and Masters students, Honours students, post- and under-graduate interns, as well as numerous under-graduate student projects.</p>

<p>I have a sustained record of scientific leadership, evidenced by more than 200 publications at prestigious journals and conferences, steadily increasing citation track, conference Best Paper awards, keynote talks and invited tutorials, sustained research funding stream, and leading large-scale research and translation activities. Currently, I am the editor-in-chief of the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tiis" target="_blank">ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems</a> and I have chaired/organised numerous international conferences. Throughout my career, I have secured over \$25M of competitive research funding and led projects in excess of \$6M.</p>

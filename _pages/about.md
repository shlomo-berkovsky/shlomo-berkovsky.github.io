I lead the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/Research-Streams/precision-health" target="_blank">Precision Health stream</a> at the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/healthy-people/centres/australian-institute-of-health-innovation/aihi-research-centres/health-informatics" target="_blank">Centre for Health Informatics</a>, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University. We focus on the use of Artificial Intelligence methods to develop patient models and personalised predictions of diagnosis and care. We also study how sensors and physiological responses can predict medical conditions, and how clinicians and patients interact with health technologies. 

Computer Scientist by training, I have theoretical and applied expertise in several areas related to human-centric applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My core research areas are user modelling, personalisation, and recommender systems, which lie on the intersection of Data Science and Human-Computer Interaction. As such, my work is around the interaction of people with information, technologies, and other people. Other areas of experise include behaviour change technologies, exergaming, and human aspects of cybersecurity. 

I have extensive experience in leading cross-functional teams and projects, both in the research and industry environments. In the past, I established the Personalised Information Delivery team of the CSIRO ICT Centre, led the Interactive Behaviour Analytics team of Data61, and managed the Data Science and Product Analytics team at Atlassian Inc. I have supervised post-doctoral fellows, PhD and Masters students, Honours theses, and projects of post- and under-graduate interns.
